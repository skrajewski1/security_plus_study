# security_plus_study
My personal study notes for the Comptia Security+ Exam.

I created this as I wanted to have a means to search for my notes faster.  Just use cltr + F to search the document.
This wasn't intended to be 100% thorough.  It's just my way of summarizing and documenting things I forgot, think I should know,
or questions I thought were good.  Feel free to use this if you think it'll help.

Thanks for reading.
