1. Note to Reader 

Below are my notes I took while studying to take the Comptia Security+ Exam.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough and is not a study guide.  It's just a personal resource I created with the aim of reducing
time looking for things. Typically I would write out my notes by hand but I found typing is faster and the Ctrl + F search function 
works for me.  I'm sharing this here because Github because I have some other work here and want to keep things simple.
In order to pass you need a score of 750 of 900 or 83%.  Most of it will be multiple choice but there are performance based questions.
Use these notes as you please.  Hope they help and thank you for reading!

3. Security Controls

logical security Controls
aka executed by computer systems, implemented with technology
examples: encryption, IDS (intrusion dection systems), firewalls


managerial security controls:
aka admin controls, aim to reduce security incidents, documented via written policies
examples: org. security policy, risk assestments, security awareness training


operational security controls
aka focus on day-to-day, ensure equipment contines to work as specified, implemented primiarly by people
examples: config management, system backups, patch management


Physcial security controls 
are designed to deter, detect, and prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction of material assets.
example: lighting, vestibules, fencing/barricades, security guards


preventive security controls: 
example: encryption, warning signs, anti virus software (AV)


deterrent security controls
examples: warning lights, lighting, video surveillance


detective security controls
examples: log monitoring, CCTV, vulnerability scanning, intrusion dection system (IDS), security audits


corrective security controls
examples: recovering data from backups, disaster recovery plans (DRP), incident response plans(IRP), applying software updates


compensating security controls
examples: backup power systems, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), network segmentation, application sandboxing


directive security controls are implemented through documentation i.e. policies, procedures, guidelines
examples: incident response plan (IRP), acceptable use policy (AUP)



4. Encryption

Self-encrypting drive (SED) = Data storage device with hardware-level encryption e.g. 
Full disk encryption (FDE)  = software tech providing confidentiality to storage devices
Encrypting File System (EFS) = MS windows component that enables encryption of individual firewalls
GNU privacy guard (GPG) = used to encrypt/sign data often for secure email + file encryption
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) = used for encrypting emails, files, and other forms of communication
HTTPS = secures web traffic via SSL/TLS encryption
Secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) = enables secure file transfer over ssh  (SFTP is not an extension of FTP!!)
Secure Shell (SSH) = type of cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication and remote CLI login
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) = provides authentication, integrity, confidentiality of IPsec
Virtual private network (VPN) = system that uses a public network but creates a private encrypted connections between remote locations
Real-time transport protocol (RTP) = unsecure real-time delivery of audio/video over an IP network
Secure real-time transport protocol (SRTP) = same as RTP only adds authentication, encryption to secure the message
CCMP = encryption protocol used in wi-fi networks implementing WPA2 standard
Transport Layer Security (TLS) = provides secure commications over a network and is successor to SSL


Techniques for encrpyting are Symmetric (secret/session key) and asymmetric (public key)
Asymmetric encryption requires public key but the message can only be decrypted by a private-key
Asymmetric ciphers: DHE, ECC, RSA
Symmetric ciphers: AES, DES, IDEA, RC4

KEK is just a second layer of crytographic keys that are used in key management systems.

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) = used to exchange cryptographic keys in IPsec VPNs
Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) = key exchange protocol that generates temporary keys for each session provinding forward secrecy to protect past and future communications
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) = if one key is compromised the other session keys are not.
ECDHE = a key exchange protrocol that leverages ECC for enhanced security and efficiency
RSA = public key cryptosystem that uses math properties of large prime numbers to secure data  (used with SSH a lot)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) = ideal for low-powered devices i.e. embedded systems, IoT, mobile for cryptographic solutions
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) = most secure/efficient encryption algorithm in use today.  (DES, RC4, 3DES are all weak encryption algos)
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) = symmetric block cipher encryption algorithm.  replaced by modern AES 
Initialization Vector (IV) = is introduced in cryptography to introduce randomness into encryption.  every ciphertext will be different with the same plaintext
Exclusive OR (XOR) = logical operation used in many cyptographic algorithms e.g. stream ciphers and encryption schemes b/c it's reversible


Cipher block chaining (CBC) = chains the ciphertext blocks together such that each one depends on the previous block.
Cipher Feedback (CFB) = transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher which can encrypt individual bits/bytes
Counter mode (CTM) = block cipher mode that combines a unique counter  with encryption key that gnerates random data blocks that are used for encrypting data
Electronic Codebook (ECB) = simplest and weakest block cipher mode.  uses same key to encrypt each block. vulnerable to pattern analysis Attacks
Galois/Counter mode (GCM) = adds authentication + CTM and is widely used in cryptography.  much better than ECB


The longer the key size/key length in cryptographic algorithms the stronger the key b/c the max number of combinations increases.
AES has 3 key lengths 128, 192, 256.  



5. Hashing


Hash function = math algo that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size hash value.
same input always makes the same hash value, fixed length, hash value changes even with small changes, collision resistance
widely used in data integrity checks, signatures, password Hashing, blockchain, crptography

Message Digest Algorithm (MD5) = deprecated due to collision vulnerabilies
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) = several versions like SHA-256, digital signatures, password storage, secure commnications, data integrity. SHA-3 very stronger

 HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) = it's SHA-256 + a secret key
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) =  non-cryptographic hash function often used for error-checking purposes



6. Digital Signatures

Digital signature = verifies authenticity and integrity of digital documents & messages using unique identifier from the sender
ECDSA, RSA, DSA can be used for verifying digital signatures.   (DSA is a gov standard)
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was specifically designed for digital signatures, not used for encryption
RSA is primarily used for secure communication (e.g. SSH) digital signatures, and data encryption
ECDSA is used for digital signatures and does not include a native encrytpion function, it's great for smartcards, mobile devices, IoT!  Fall under ECC category.



7. Digital Certificates

Digital certificates = digital document that verifies an individual, device, service, organization in online commications
Registration Authority (RA) role in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is accpeting requests for digital certs & authenticating the entity making the request
Certificate Authority (CA)  acts as a third-party of digital certs
Certificate Revocation list (CRL) list of revoked certs issed by CA of the PKI make sure revoked certs aren't trusted
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) = protocol that checks if the revocation status of a cert, better/faster than relying on a published CRL.  This is the fastest!!
Self signed dig. certs. are not trusted by default by web browsers/applications, typically used in trusted environments i.e. internal networks, not backed by trusted/well-known third party
Self  signed certs are free and have no identity validaton.  third party certs cost and require identity validation
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) = file that contains information to send to the cert authority (CA).  CSR contains info about entity, public key, identifying details which CA uses to issue the digital cert
Wildcard certificate is used to secure multiple subdomains under a primary domain.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) cert = lets you secure multiple domain names or subdomains with a single cert
Object Identifier (OID) = used to uniquely identify PKI objects



8. Threat Actor Types

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) sophisticated prolonged cyberattacks carried out by usually nation-states.  usually used to maintain long-term access to sensitive systems or data
Shadow IT is IT personnel using unapproved cloud services, apps, devices for work purposes potentially creating security risks and compliance issues.



9. Threat Vectors & Attack Surfaces

attack surface =  refers to all the potential points through which an attacker can interact with a system or network. 

email-based threat vector:
spoofing
phishing
BEC Attacks
Malicious links
Malware attachments

Smishing = is text messages to deliver fraudulent messages aimed at stealing sensitive information  (combo of SMS and phishing)

Instant Messaging threat vectos:
phishing attack 
malware distribution 
spoofing attack
eavesdropping
account hijacking
malicious link/attachments


image-based threat Vectors
steganography (hiding code within an image file)
image spoofing (deepfakes)
malware-embedded images


file-based threat vector
PDF exploits
Malicious macros in documents
Compressed files (ZIP, RAR)
Malicious scripts in web pages
Infected images
Malicious executables


vishing = voice phishing i.e. person calls you to get sensitive info.  

removable devices have 2 threat vectors malware delivery and data exfiltration

client based threat-vectors
 Drive-by download via web browser
 Malicious macro
 usb-based attack
 Infected executable file
 Malicious attachment in email application


agentless software threat vectors
 network protocol vulnerability
 Packet sniffing


Bluetooth threat vectors
bluesmacking i.e. DoS 
Bluejacking: sending unwanted messages usually as a prank
Bluesnarfing: unauthorized access to a bluetooth device to steal data such as contacts,messages
Bluebugging: gaining remote control over bluetooth device to eavesdropping


open service ports are usually the most probable cause of unauthorized access to be exploited on a network entry points
many devices come from the factory with default credentials i.e. username/password that should be changed because they can be looked up online relatively easily.

Common threat vectors for managed service providers (MSPs), vendors, and suppliers are propagation of malware and social engineering techniques (i.e. targeting employees with sensitive data)

unsupported systems/apps that don't receive regular updates/patches are often volnerable to exploits

wireless technologies considered to have potential threat vectors
WPS (wi-fi protected setup)
WEP (wired equivalent privacy)
WPA2WPA2



10. Social Engineering


phishing = attackers impersonate legitimate entity to get access
vishing = voice phishing is a social engineering technique that uses telephone system i.e. calls 
smihing = is using sms or text messages to get sensitive data
misinformation = false or misleading info spread UNintentionally
Disinformation = intentially spreading false info


pretexting is social engineering that relies on identity fraud i.e. attacker impersonates someone with a legitimate need for the information, relying on identity fraud as a method of deception
pretexting invovles creating a fabricated scenario i.e. pretext

BEC (business email compromise) = type of phishing that relies on impersonating a business leader/executable

websites are susceptible to watering hole Attacks e.g. attacker makes a fake website similar to the real one and steals the personal info when users login. That's brand impersonation




11. Security Vulnerabilities


memory injection: application attack that introduces external code into address space of a running program

dynamic link library (DLL): a collection of precompiled functions, allows code to be shared across programs reducing Redundancy
DLL injection application attack that executes a library of code

Buffer overflow: Application overwrites the contents of a memory area that it shouldn't have access to. can cause crashes, data corruption, or even execute malicious code
race condition: A malfunction in a preprogrammed sequential access to a shared resource 
TOC/TOU A type of vulnerability where the state of a resource is verified at one point in time but may change before the resource is actually used

Common type of OS-based vulnerability are:
   Access control and permissions vulnerabilities (weak passwords, privilege escalation)
   Vulnerabilities in installed applications, system utilities, and device drivers
   Memory-related vulnerabilities (memory leaks, buffer overflows, race conditions)
   Patch and update management vulnerabilities (security patch and update delays, malicious updates)
   Vulnerabilities related to system/security misconfigurations
   Network-related vulnerabilities (DoS attacks, remote code execution attacks) 



SQLi (SQL Injection) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to insert malicious code (typically SQL statements) into input fields, such as search bars or login forms, to manipulate or execute unauthorized commands on a database.
example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE userName = 'Alice' AND password = '' OR '1' = '1';
Here, the condition '1' = '1' is always true, effectively bypassing authentication by making the WHERE clause evaluate to true regardless of the username or password, allowing unauthorized access to all user records.

Example of XSS (cross-site scripting) attack
Exploits the trust a user's web browser has in a website
A malicious script is injected into a trusted website
User's browser executes attacker's script


End of Life (EOL) when a product will likely not receive security patches and other updates

VM escape is where the attacker breaks out of the VM and gains access to the hypervisor or host system
Resource reuse: resources that have been properly allocated might hide a malicious VM that uses that residual data to compromise another VM.

sideloading: installing mobile apps from sources other than official app stroes
jailbreaking: removing software restrictions imposed by apple on it's iOS operating system
rooting: gaining admin(root) access to the OS and system apps on android devicies

zero-day attack: type of attack aimed at exploiting vulnerability that is present in already released software



12. Malware Attacks


Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system by encrypting files or locking the entire system, 
demanding that the user perform a specific action—typically paying a ransom—to regain access


Trojan horse is a type of software/app that is legit but contains malicious code
RAT (remote access trojan) is one that allows unauthorized access to infected device

Worm is a replicating type of malicious program that can spread across networks.  It basically uses up bandwidth and system resources
spyware gathers info about activity like keystrokes, browsing habits, personal details, without the user's knowledge



13. Network Attacks

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, the attacker uses multiple compromised systems (often called zombies) that are part of a botnet to flood the target with traffic
Amplified DDoS attack - it just sends a test (small) request to vulnerable servers followed by larger response

reflected DDoS attack just uses third party servers to with the targets ip spoofed as the source.

DNS amplication attack is like amplifed/reflected DDoS attacks execpt it just exploits open/misconfigured DNS resolvers to generate large traffic directed at a victim
DNS spoofing - also called DNS cache poisoning. provide false DNS info to a DNS resolvers

DNS cache poisioning Remapping a domain name to a rogue IP address

domain hijacking - losing control over the domain names due to unlawful applications
Bluesnarfing - gaining unauthorized access to a bluetooth device

wireless disassociation attack e.g. deauthentication, DoS attack
wireless jamming attack would be a DoS attack
IV (Initialization vector) attack focuses on exploiting vulnerabilies in WEP


on-path attack is also known as a MITM attack, attackers are on the comms route between two devices, attackers intercept/modify comms
network replay attack = attacker captures sensitive data, resends to reciver trying to gain unauthorized access/tricking the reciver.

Session ID has unique identifier, data can be sotred in cookie or embedded as URL parameter, typically stored in client browser
Session replay attack is when the session id is taken and reused to impersonate a user.
Pass the hash = attacker uses hash of the user's password instead of the cleartext.  Some systems accept hash passwords.



14. Application Attacks

code injection is how XSS attacks happen i.e inject malicious script to the user.
LDAP injection exploits a protocol used for managing and accessing networked resources
XML injection targets web apps that generat contnet used to store and transport data
Buffer overflow exploits occurs when an attacker overwirtes contents of memory to cuase unpredictable results in an app.
Replay attack intercepts and retransmits valid data exchange between an application and server or another application.


Facilitates privilege escalation attacks
    System/application vulnerabilities
    System/application misconfigurations
    Social engineering techniques


CSRF/XSRF 
    Exploits the trust a website has in the user's web browser
    A user is tricked by an attacker into submitting unauthorized web requests
    Website executes attacker's requests



dot-dot-slash = directory traversal attack
for example:
 http://www.example.com/var/../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/../../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/files/../../../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/files/images/../../../../etc/passwd
