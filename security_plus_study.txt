1. Note to Reader 

Below are my notes I took while studying to take the Comptia Security+ Exam.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough and is not a study guide.  It's just a personal resource I created with the aim of reducing
time looking for things. Typically I would write out my notes by hand but I found typing is faster and the Ctrl + F search function 
works for me.  I'm sharing this here because Github because I have some other work here and want to keep things simple.
In order to pass you need a score of 750 of 900 or 83%.  Most of it will be multiple choice but there are performance based questions.
Use these notes as you please.  Hope they help and thank you for reading!

3. Security Controls

logical security Controls
aka executed by computer systems, implemented with technology
examples: encryption, IDS (intrusion dection systems), firewalls


managerial security controls:
aka admin controls, aim to reduce security incidents, documented via written policies
examples: org. security policy, risk assestments, security awareness training


operational security controls
aka focus on day-to-day, ensure equipment contines to work as specified, implemented primiarly by people
examples: config management, system backups, patch management


Physcial security controls 
are designed to deter, detect, and prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction of material assets.
example: lighting, vestibules, fencing/barricades, security guards


preventive security controls: 
example: encryption, warning signs, anti virus software (AV)


deterrent security controls
examples: warning lights, lighting, video surveillance


detective security controls
examples: log monitoring, CCTV, vulnerability scanning, intrusion dection system (IDS), security audits


corrective security controls
examples: recovering data from backups, disaster recovery plans (DRP), incident response plans(IRP), applying software updates


compensating security controls
examples: backup power systems, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), network segmentation, application sandboxing


directive security controls are implemented through documentation i.e. policies, procedures, guidelines
examples: incident response plan (IRP), acceptable use policy (AUP)



4. Encryption

Self-encrypting drive (SED) = Data storage device with hardware-level encryption e.g. 
Full disk encryption (FDE)  = software tech providing confidentiality to storage devices
Encrypting File System (EFS) = MS windows component that enables encryption of individual firewalls
GNU privacy guard (GPG) = used to encrypt/sign data often for secure email + file encryption
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) = used for encrypting emails, files, and other forms of communication
HTTPS = secures web traffic via SSL/TLS encryption
Secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) = enables secure file transfer over ssh  (SFTP is not an extension of FTP!!)
Secure Shell (SSH) = type of cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication and remote CLI login
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) = provides authentication, integrity, confidentiality of IPsec
Virtual private network (VPN) = system that uses a public network but creates a private encrypted connections between remote locations
Real-time transport protocol (RTP) = unsecure real-time delivery of audio/video over an IP network
Secure real-time transport protocol (SRTP) = same as RTP only adds authentication, encryption to secure the message
CCMP = encryption protocol used in wi-fi networks implementing WPA2 standard
Transport Layer Security (TLS) = provides secure commications over a network and is successor to SSL


Techniques for encrpyting are Symmetric (secret/session key) and asymmetric (public key)
Asymmetric encryption requires public key but the message can only be decrypted by a private-key
Asymmetric ciphers: DHE, ECC, RSA
Symmetric ciphers: AES, DES, IDEA, RC4

KEK is just a second layer of crytographic keys that are used in key management systems.

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) = used to exchange cryptographic keys in IPsec VPNs
Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) = key exchange protocol that generates temporary keys for each session provinding forward secrecy to protect past and future communications
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) = if one key is compromised the other session keys are not.
ECDHE = a key exchange protrocol that leverages ECC for enhanced security and efficiency
RSA = public key cryptosystem that uses math properties of large prime numbers to secure data  (used with SSH a lot)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) = ideal for low-powered devices i.e. embedded systems, IoT, mobile for cryptographic solutions
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) = most secure/efficient encryption algorithm in use today.  (DES, RC4, 3DES are all weak encryption algos)
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) = symmetric block cipher encryption algorithm.  replaced by modern AES 
Initialization Vector (IV) = is introduced in cryptography to introduce randomness into encryption.  every ciphertext will be different with the same plaintext
Exclusive OR (XOR) = logical operation used in many cyptographic algorithms e.g. stream ciphers and encryption schemes b/c it's reversible


Cipher block chaining (CBC) = chains the ciphertext blocks together such that each one depends on the previous block.
Cipher Feedback (CFB) = transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher which can encrypt individual bits/bytes
Counter mode (CTM) = block cipher mode that combines a unique counter  with encryption key that gnerates random data blocks that are used for encrypting data
Electronic Codebook (ECB) = simplest and weakest block cipher mode.  uses same key to encrypt each block. vulnerable to pattern analysis Attacks
Galois/Counter mode (GCM) = adds authentication + CTM and is widely used in cryptography.  much better than ECB


The longer the key size/key length in cryptographic algorithms the stronger the key b/c the max number of combinations increases.
AES has 3 key lengths 128, 192, 256.  



5. Hashing


Hash function = math algo that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size hash value.
same input always makes the same hash value, fixed length, hash value changes even with small changes, collision resistance
widely used in data integrity checks, signatures, password Hashing, blockchain, crptography

Message Digest Algorithm (MD5) = deprecated due to collision vulnerabilies
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) = several versions like SHA-256, digital signatures, password storage, secure commnications, data integrity. SHA-3 very stronger

 HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) = it's SHA-256 + a secret key
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) =  non-cryptographic hash function often used for error-checking purposes



6. Digital Signatures

Digital signature = verifies authenticity and integrity of digital documents & messages using unique identifier from the sender
ECDSA, RSA, DSA can be used for verifying digital signatures.   (DSA is a gov standard)
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was specifically designed for digital signatures, not used for encryption
RSA is primarily used for secure communication (e.g. SSH) digital signatures, and data encryption
ECDSA is used for digital signatures and does not include a native encrytpion function, it's great for smartcards, mobile devices, IoT!  Fall under ECC category.



7. Digital Certificates

Digital certificates = digital document that verifies an individual, device, service, organization in online commications
Registration Authority (RA) role in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is accpeting requests for digital certs & authenticating the entity making the request
Certificate Authority (CA)  acts as a third-party of digital certs
Certificate Revocation list (CRL) list of revoked certs issed by CA of the PKI make sure revoked certs aren't trusted
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) = protocol that checks if the revocation status of a cert, better/faster than relying on a published CRL.  This is the fastest!!
Self signed dig. certs. are not trusted by default by web browsers/applications, typically used in trusted environments i.e. internal networks, not backed by trusted/well-known third party
Self  signed certs are free and have no identity validaton.  third party certs cost and require identity validation
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) = file that contains information to send to the cert authority (CA).  CSR contains info about entity, public key, identifying details which CA uses to issue the digital cert
Wildcard certificate is used to secure multiple subdomains under a primary domain.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) cert = lets you secure multiple domain names or subdomains with a single cert
Object Identifier (OID) = used to uniquely identify PKI objects
