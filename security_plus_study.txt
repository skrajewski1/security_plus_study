1. Note to Reader 

Below are my notes I took while studying to take the Comptia Security+ Exam.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough and is not a study guide.  It's just a personal resource I created with the aim of reducing
time looking for things. Typically I would write out my notes by hand but I found typing is faster and the Ctrl + F search function 
works for me.  I'm sharing this here because Github because I have some other work here and want to keep things simple.
In order to pass you need a score of 750 of 900 or 83%.  Most of it will be multiple choice but there are performance based questions.
Use these notes as you please.  Hope they help and thank you for reading!
