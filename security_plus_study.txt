1. Note to Reader 

Below are my notes I took while studying to take the Comptia Security+ Exam.
This isn't meant to be 100% thorough and is not a study guide.  It's just a personal resource I created with the aim of reducing
time looking for things. Typically I would write out my notes by hand but I found typing is faster and the Ctrl + F search function 
works for me.  I'm sharing this here because Github because I have some other work here and want to keep things simple.
In order to pass you need a score of 750 of 900 or 83%.  Most of it will be multiple choice but there are performance based questions.
Use these notes as you please.  Hope they help and thank you for reading!

3. Security Controls

logical security Controls
aka executed by computer systems, implemented with technology
examples: encryption, IDS (intrusion dection systems), firewalls


managerial security controls:
aka admin controls, aim to reduce security incidents, documented via written policies
examples: org. security policy, risk assestments, security awareness training


operational security controls
aka focus on day-to-day, ensure equipment contines to work as specified, implemented primiarly by people
examples: config management, system backups, patch management


Physical security controls 
are designed to deter, detect, and prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage, or destruction of material assets.
example: lighting, vestibules, fencing/barricades, security guards


preventive security controls: 
example: encryption, warning signs, anti virus software (AV)


deterrent security controls
examples: warning lights, lighting, video surveillance


detective security controls
examples: log monitoring, CCTV, vulnerability scanning, intrusion dection system (IDS), security audits


corrective security controls
examples: recovering data from backups, disaster recovery plans (DRP), incident response plans(IRP), applying software updates


compensating security controls
examples: backup power systems, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), network segmentation, application sandboxing


directive security controls are implemented through documentation i.e. policies, procedures, guidelines
examples: incident response plan (IRP), acceptable use policy (AUP)


CIA triad = confidentiality, integrity, availability   (CIA is basic to information security)


AAA = Authentication, authorization, accounting   (e.g. TACACS+ and RADIUS)
authentication methods for people = usernames/passwords, biometrics, MFA
authentication methods for devices = digital certificates, MFA, MAC addresses




4. Encryption

Self-encrypting drive (SED) = Data storage device with hardware-level encryption e.g. 
Full disk encryption (FDE)  = software tech providing confidentiality to storage devices
Encrypting File System (EFS) = MS windows component that enables encryption of individual firewalls
GNU privacy guard (GPG) = used to encrypt/sign data often for secure email + file encryption
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) = used for encrypting emails, files, and other forms of communication
HTTPS = secures web traffic via SSL/TLS encryption
Secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) = enables secure file transfer over ssh  (SFTP is not an extension of FTP!!)
Secure Shell (SSH) = type of cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication and remote CLI login
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) = provides authentication, integrity, confidentiality of IPsec
Virtual private network (VPN) = system that uses a public network but creates a private encrypted connections between remote locations
Real-time transport protocol (RTP) = unsecure real-time delivery of audio/video over an IP network
Secure real-time transport protocol (SRTP) = same as RTP only adds authentication, encryption to secure the message
CCMP = encryption protocol used in wi-fi networks implementing WPA2 standard
Transport Layer Security (TLS) = provides secure commications over a network and is successor to SSL


Techniques for encrpyting are Symmetric (secret/session key) and asymmetric (public key)
Asymmetric encryption requires public key but the message can only be decrypted by a private-key
Asymmetric ciphers: DHE, ECC, RSA
Symmetric ciphers: AES, DES, IDEA, RC4

KEK is just a second layer of crytographic keys that are used in key management systems.

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) = used to exchange cryptographic keys in IPsec VPNs
Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) = key exchange protocol that generates temporary keys for each session provinding forward secrecy to protect past and future communications
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) = if one key is compromised the other session keys are not.
ECDHE = a key exchange protrocol that leverages ECC for enhanced security and efficiency
RSA = public key cryptosystem that uses math properties of large prime numbers to secure data  (used with SSH a lot)
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) = ideal for low-powered devices i.e. embedded systems, IoT, mobile for cryptographic solutions
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) = most secure/efficient encryption algorithm in use today.  (DES, RC4, 3DES are all weak encryption algos)
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) = symmetric block cipher encryption algorithm.  replaced by modern AES 
Initialization Vector (IV) = is introduced in cryptography to introduce randomness into encryption.  every ciphertext will be different with the same plaintext
Exclusive OR (XOR) = logical operation used in many cyptographic algorithms e.g. stream ciphers and encryption schemes b/c it's reversible


Cipher block chaining (CBC) = chains the ciphertext blocks together such that each one depends on the previous block.
Cipher Feedback (CFB) = transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher which can encrypt individual bits/bytes
Counter mode (CTM) = block cipher mode that combines a unique counter  with encryption key that gnerates random data blocks that are used for encrypting data
Electronic Codebook (ECB) = simplest and weakest block cipher mode.  uses same key to encrypt each block. vulnerable to pattern analysis Attacks
Galois/Counter mode (GCM) = adds authentication + CTM and is widely used in cryptography.  much better than ECB


The longer the key size/key length in cryptographic algorithms the stronger the key b/c the max number of combinations increases.
AES has 3 key lengths 128, 192, 256.  



5. Hashing


Hash function = math algo that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size hash value.
same input always makes the same hash value, fixed length, hash value changes even with small changes, collision resistance
widely used in data integrity checks, signatures, password Hashing, blockchain, crptography

Message Digest Algorithm (MD5) = deprecated due to collision vulnerabilies
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) = several versions like SHA-256, digital signatures, password storage, secure commnications, data integrity. SHA-3 very stronger

 HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) = it's SHA-256 + a secret key
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) =  non-cryptographic hash function often used for error-checking purposes



6. Digital Signatures

Digital signature = verifies authenticity and integrity of digital documents & messages using unique identifier from the sender
ECDSA, RSA, DSA can be used for verifying digital signatures.   (DSA is a gov standard)
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was specifically designed for digital signatures, not used for encryption
RSA is primarily used for secure communication (e.g. SSH) digital signatures, and data encryption
ECDSA is used for digital signatures and does not include a native encrytpion function, it's great for smartcards, mobile devices, IoT!  Fall under ECC category.



7. Digital Certificates

Digital certificates = digital document that verifies an individual, device, service, organization in online commications
Registration Authority (RA) role in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is accpeting requests for digital certs & authenticating the entity making the request
Certificate Authority (CA)  acts as a third-party of digital certs
Certificate Revocation list (CRL) list of revoked certs issed by CA of the PKI make sure revoked certs aren't trusted
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) = protocol that checks if the revocation status of a cert, better/faster than relying on a published CRL.  This is the fastest!!
Self signed dig. certs. are not trusted by default by web browsers/applications, typically used in trusted environments i.e. internal networks, not backed by trusted/well-known third party
Self  signed certs are free and have no identity validaton.  third party certs cost and require identity validation
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) = file that contains information to send to the cert authority (CA).  CSR contains info about entity, public key, identifying details which CA uses to issue the digital cert
Wildcard certificate is used to secure multiple subdomains under a primary domain.
Subject Alternative Name (SAN) cert = lets you secure multiple domain names or subdomains with a single cert
Object Identifier (OID) = used to uniquely identify PKI objects

Bluebugging: gaining remote control over bluetooth device to eavesdropping


open service ports are usually the most probable cause of unauthorized access to be exploited on a network entry points
many devices come from the factory with default credentials i.e. username/password that should be changed because they can be looked up online relatively easily.

Common threat vectors for managed service providers (MSPs), vendors, and suppliers are propagation of malware and social engineering techniques (i.e. targeting employees with sensitive data)

unsupported systems/apps that don't receive regular updates/patches are often volnerable to exploits

wireless technologies considered to have potential threat vectors
WPS (wi-fi protected setup)
WEP (wired equivalent privacy)
WPA2WPA2




10. Social Engineering

vishing = voice phishing is a social engineering technique that uses telephone system i.e. calls 
smihing = is using sms or text messages to get sensitive data
misinformation = false or misleading info spread UNintentionally
Disinformation = intentially spreading false info


pretexting is social engineering that relies on identity fraud i.e. attacker impersonates someone with a legitimate need for the information, relying on identity fraud as a method of deception
pretexting invovles creating a fabricated scenario i.e. pretext

BEC (business email compromise) = type of phishing that relies on impersonating a business leader/executable

websites are susceptible to watering hole Attacks e.g. attacker makes a fake website similar to the real one and steals the personal info when users login. That's brand impersonation





11. Security Vulnerabilities


memory injection: application attack that introduces external code into address space of a running program

dynamic link library (DLL): a collection of precompiled functions, allows code to be shared across programs reducing Redundancy
DLL injection application attack that executes a library of code

Buffer overflow: Application overwrites the contents of a memory area that it shouldn't have access to. can cause crashes, data corruption, or even execute malicious code
race condition: A malfunction in a preprogrammed sequential access to a shared resource 
TOC/TOU A type of vulnerability where the state of a resource is verified at one point in time but may change before the resource is actually used

Common type of OS-based vulnerability are:
   Access control and permissions vulnerabilities (weak passwords, privilege escalation)
   Vulnerabilities in installed applications, system utilities, and device drivers
   Memory-related vulnerabilities (memory leaks, buffer overflows, race conditions)
   Patch and update management vulnerabilities (security patch and update delays, malicious updates)
   Vulnerabilities related to system/security misconfigurations
   Network-related vulnerabilities (DoS attacks, remote code execution attacks) 



SQLi (SQL Injection) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to insert malicious code (typically SQL statements) into input fields, such as search bars or login forms, to manipulate or execute unauthorized commands on a database.
example: SELECT * FROM users WHERE userName = 'Alice' AND password = '' OR '1' = '1';
Here, the condition '1' = '1' is always true, effectively bypassing authentication by making the WHERE clause evaluate to true regardless of the username or password, allowing unauthorized access to all user records.

Example of XSS (cross-site scripting) attack
Exploits the trust a user's web browser has in a website
A malicious script is injected into a trusted website
User's browser executes attacker's script


End of Life (EOL) when a product will likely not receive security patches and other updates

VM escape is where the attacker breaks out of the VM and gains access to the hypervisor or host system
Resource reuse: resources that have been properly allocated might hide a malicious VM that uses that residual data to compromise another VM.

sideloading: installing mobile apps from sources other than official app stroes
jailbreaking: removing software restrictions imposed by apple on it's iOS operating system
rooting: gaining admin(root) access to the OS and system apps on android devicies

zero-day attack: type of attack aimed at exploiting vulnerability that is present in already released software




12. Malware Attacks


Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system by encrypting files or locking the entire system, 
demanding that the user perform a specific action—typically paying a ransom—to regain access


Trojan horse is a type of software/app that is legit but contains malicious code
RAT (remote access trojan) is one that allows unauthorized access to infected device

Worm is a replicating type of malicious program that can spread across networks.  It basically uses up bandwidth and system resources
spyware gathers info about activity like keystrokes, browsing habits, personal details, without the user's knowledge




13. Network Attacks

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, the attacker uses multiple compromised systems (often called zombies) that are part of a botnet to flood the target with traffic
Amplified DDoS attack - it just sends a test (small) request to vulnerable servers followed by larger response

reflected DDoS attack just uses third party servers to with the targets ip spoofed as the source.

DNS amplication attack is like amplifed/reflected DDoS attacks execpt it just exploits open/misconfigured DNS resolvers to generate large traffic directed at a victim
DNS spoofing - also called DNS cache poisoning. provide false DNS info to a DNS resolvers

DNS cache poisioning Remapping a domain name to a rogue IP address

domain hijacking - losing control over the domain names due to unlawful applications
Bluesnarfing - gaining unauthorized access to a bluetooth device

wireless disassociation attack e.g. deauthentication, DoS attack
wireless jamming attack would be a DoS attack
IV (Initialization vector) attack focuses on exploiting vulnerabilies in WEP


on-path attack is also known as a MITM attack, attackers are on the comms route between two devices, attackers intercept/modify comms
network replay attack = attacker captures sensitive data, resends to reciver trying to gain unauthorized access/tricking the reciver.

Session ID has unique identifier, data can be sotred in cookie or embedded as URL parameter, typically stored in client browser
Session replay attack is when the session id is taken and reused to impersonate a user.
Pass the hash = attacker uses hash of the user's password instead of the cleartext.  Some systems accept hash passwords.




14. Application Attacks

code injection is how XSS attacks happen i.e inject malicious script to the user.
LDAP injection exploits a protocol used for managing and accessing networked resources
XML injection targets web apps that generat contnet used to store and transport data
Buffer overflow exploits occurs when an attacker overwirtes contents of memory to cuase unpredictable results in an app.
Replay attack intercepts and retransmits valid data exchange between an application and server or another application.


Facilitates privilege escalation attacks
    System/application vulnerabilities
    System/application misconfigurations
    Social engineering techniques


CSRF/XSRF 
    Exploits the trust a website has in the user's web browser
    A user is tricked by an attacker into submitting unauthorized web requests
    Website executes attacker's requests



dot-dot-slash = directory traversal attack
for example:
 http://www.example.com/var/../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/../../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/files/../../../etc/passwd
 http://www.example.com/var/www/files/images/../../../../etc/passwd





15. Indicators of Malicious Activity

Indicator of Compromise (IoC) forensic evidence that helps detect unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, other malicious activities
password brute-forcing attempt can cause an account lockout
Concurrent session usage is when a single acocunt is being used from multiple locations/devices at the same time
Blocked Content is an indicator where a firewall or security measure prevents attempt to deliver malicious payload/authorized action.

Impossible travel is a situation wherein an account is accessed from a location that is physically impossible for the user to be in
Out of cycle logging = logs are make outside of there regular intervals/with abnormal values which might signal malicious activity




16. Data Protection Concepts

Encryption coverts plaintext data into ciphertext using an algorithm
hashing takes data and converts it into fixed-sized scripting

Data masking:
    replacing sensitive data with fake/modified data while retaining its original form
    allows for data manipulation in environments wehre the actual values are not needed


tokenization = sensitive data is stored in a separate location but can be retrieved with non-sensitive replacement
and can be processed just like original data without revealing the contents.

Obfuscation = modifies data to make it difficult to understand/reverse engineer (not always with encryption/hiding)


segmentation for securing data advantages
    limits spread of cyberattacks
    compliance i.e. isolating/protecting specific data
    limits user access to sensitive Data


access control mechanisms: ACL, FACL, DAC, MAC, RBAC




17. Resilience & Recovery


RAID 0
Requires a minimum of 2 drives to implement
Is also known as disk striping
Decreases reliability (failure of any disk in the array results in the loss of all data in the array)
Is suitable for systems where performance has higher priority than fault tolerance


RAID 1
Requires at least 2 drives to implement
Offers improved reliability by creating identical data sets on each drive (failure of one drive does not destroy the array as each drive contains identical copy of the data)
Is also referred to as disk mirroring


RAID 5
Requires at least 3 drives to implement
Offers increased performance and fault tolerance (single drive failure does not destroy the array and lost data can be re-created by the remaining drives)
Is also known as disk striping with parity


RAID 6
Requires at least 4 drives to implement
Offers increased performance and fault tolerance (failure of up to 2 drives does not destroy the array and lost data can be re-created by the remaining drives)
Is also known as disk striping with double parity


RAID 10
Requires a minimum of 4 drives to implement
Is referred to as stripe of mirrors, i.e., a combination of RAID 1 (disk mirroring) and RAID 0 (disk striping)
Offers increased performance and fault tolerance (failure of one drive in each mirrored pair of disk drives does not destroy the array)


Only RAID 0 offers not fault tolerance
Load balancing distributes workload across multiple servers for better performance
Primary reason why we cluster is to provide high availability and fault tolerance


Hot site is a fully operational duplicate of the original site
Warm site that has some pre-installed hardware and network configurations, but it requires additional setup before becoming fully operational
cold site provides only the physical space, such as power, cooling, and networking, but lacks the necessary hardware, software, and data.

Continuity of Operations plan

PEAP (Protected Extensible authentication protocol) = open standard wireless network auth that encapsulates auth process in encrypted TLS tunnel




19. Application Security

Critical to secure app developemnt: 
Input validation   (e.g. web form field accepting data from server commands)  
error and exception handling

Input validation helps protect against SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS)
secure cookie  = type of http cookie that is enrypted over HTTPS that prevents it from being intercepted/tampered during transit
static code analysis = manual review of code to dectect logic/syntax errors.   you are not running the code to see errors (i.e. it's static)

Passively tests security controls

Features of Static Code Analysis:
Involves examining the code without executing it
Often used early in the development process
Examines code structure, syntax, and semantics to detect issues like syntax errors, coding standards violations, security vulnerabilities, and bugs

Features of Dynamic Code Analysis:
Typically used later in the software development lifecycle
Analyzes runtime properties like memory usage, performance, and error handling to identify issues such as memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, and runtime errors
Involves executing the code and analyzing its behavior at runtime

Package monitoring = tacking and managing software app components such as 3rd party libraries and other dependencies
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) = threat intelligence from public data sources

Tactics, Techniques, and procedures (TTP) = insignts into the methods and tools used by cybercriminals to carry out attacks

Penetration testing:
Bypasses security controls
Actively tests security controls
Exploidts vulnerabilities


Responsible disclosure program encourages: security research, ethical hackers, report vulnerabilies, and bug bounty program ($$ for finding valid vulnerabilies)
False positive error = antivirus software identifyig non-malicious file as a virus due to faulty virus signature
False negative = situation where an attack occure but no alarm or alert is raised i.e. undectected attack.
FRR (false rejection rate) = measures the likelihood that a security system will incorrectly reject an acess attpempt by an authroised user
ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) =  framework that provides a detailed understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries during cyberattacks.
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) = ndustry standard used for assessing and scoring the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities, providing a way to evaluate their impact based on factors like exploitability and potential damage.
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) =  refers to a system that identifies, defines, and catalogs publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.


EF (exposure factor) = degree of loss that a realized threat would have on a specific assets


Examples of vulnerability response and remediation techniques:

Ensuring financial recovery from the costs associated with a successful cyberattack (insurance) 
Dividing a network into smaller, isolated zones to limit the potential impact of a vulnerability (segmentation)
Mitigating the risk associated with a vulnerability that cannot be immediately patched by implementing alternative security measures (compensating controls)
Delaying or forgoing a patch for a specific system, e.g., when applying a patch may not be feasible due to compatibility issues or potential disruptions to critical systems (exceptions and exemptions)





21. Secure Network Protocols


HTTPS = secure webrowsing
Secure file transfer are = FTPS (FTP secure) and SFTP (ssh FTP)
FTPS = runs on TCP port 990 (implicit)  or TCP port 21 (explicit).  Uses SSL/TLS to secure the connection.  SFTP uses ssh protocol
SMTPS is deprecated, used for emails, now we use SMTP with STARTTLS
IMAPS and POP3S = allow for secure retrieval of emails from a mail server to an email client by encrypting the communication using SSL/TLS
SRTP (secure real-time transport protocol) = SRTP is used to provide encryption, authentication and integrity for real time multimedia communciation like video/audio calls over ip networks




22. Access Controls

Mandatory Access Control (MAC):
Users are not allowed to change access policies at their own discretion
Labels and clearance levels can only be applied and changed by an administrator
Every resource has a sensitivity label matching a clearance level assigned to a user
(MAC is the strictest set of access rules)

RuBAC = allows for defining granular rules that consider user roles, time constraints, and network access restrictions

Discretionary Access Control (DAC): access control model based on user identity.
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) = user permissions are based on their specific roles and responsibilities within an organization.

ABAC (attribute-based access control) = access control decisions are made based on a variety of attributes (such as user roles, time, location, network access, and more)  This is the most human readable!!
Properties of ABAC
Subject (i.e., user or process requesting access)
Type of action (for example "read", "write", "execute")
Resource type (medical record, bank account etc.)
Environment (contextual data, such as time of day or geolocation)

time-of-day restrictions would be the most suitable for scheduling system maintenance task during periods of low user activity

principle of least privilege is a security rule that prevents users from accessing information and resources that lie beyond the scope of their responsibilities.

Non-repudiation = ensures that an entity cannot deny the authenticity of a transaction or communication. e.g. digital signatures, hashing, digital certs.




23. Password Concepts

Max password age policy is the most effective in decreasing the risk of a security breach

Can be used as passowrdless auth: biometrics, hardware towkens, qr codes, otps, passkeys 
data masking = Replacing password characters in a password field with a series of asterisks
Salt = random data added to a password before hashing.  countermeasure against brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks
"Pass the hash" attack, an attacker uses a hashed version of the password (instead of the cleartext password) to authenticate to a remote server.
spraying attack involves trying a small set of commonly used passwords (often very simple or popular ones) against a large number of user accounts. it bypasses account-lockout policies




24. Incident Response Activities


Preparation stage
phase involves establishing and maintaining the incident response capability, 
setting up an incident response team, developing incident response plans, and 
preparing necessary tools and resources to respond to security incidents effectively.


Detection and analysis stage
involves identifying and understanding potential incidents to determine their scope, impact, and root cause


Containment, eradication, and recovery stage
Restoring normal operations
Eliminating the threat
Mitigating the impact of the incident


Post-incident activity stage
involves updating incident response plans, policies, and procedures


Threat hunting is actively search for indicators of compromise (IoCs) before they evolve into more serious incidents


chain of custody refers to the documented process that tracks the handling, movement, and storage of evidence to ensure its integrity and admissibility in court.
(basically evidence isn't tampered with) 

E-discovery (electronic discovery) refers to the process of identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) 
for use in legal proceedings or investigations.




25. Risk Management Concepts

risk assessment = process of determining potential risks that could affect an organization's ability to achieve its objectives
risk analysis = The process of evaluating discovered risks to understand their potential impact and likelihood 
Ad hoc =  risk assessment method based on need, typically conducted in response to specific events or changes, such as after a major organizational change or a security breach
Quarterly or annual risk assessments  are an example of recurring risk assesstment
One-time risk assesstment = has a specific purpose i.e. for a new product lauch
Real-time monitoring of network security threats is an example of continous risk assessment


Qualitative risk assessment = is based on subjective judgment and focuses on the likelihood and impact of risks, 
often using descriptive terms like "high," "medium," and "low" rather than numerical values.

Single loss expectancy (SLE) = involves numerical values to estimate the potential financial impact of a risk.  Example of quatitative risk assessement
ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy) = estimated yearly financial loss due to a specific risk, calculated by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) by the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO).


SLE=Asset Value (AV)×Exposure Factor (EF)

Risk register = omprehensive document used in risk management and project management to identify, assess, and track risks
Risk tolerance = refers to specific level of risk an org is willing to accept to accomplish goals
Risk appetite = general term that describes an organization’s overall attitude towards risk-taking

example of Risk transference:   Contracting out a specialized technical component when the company's employees lack the necessary skill
example of cyber insurance:   Cybersecurity insurance transfers the financial risk of a cyber incident to the insurance company, meaning the organization is shifting the burden of potential financial loss to another party.

Exemption =  choosing not to apply certain controls or safeguards for a specific risk
Execption = the practice of temporarily not complying with a standard or policy due to a specific risk scenario

risk avoidance = for example, disabling certain system functions or shutting down the system when risks are identified
risk mitigation = the process of taking proactive measures to reduce the impact of identified risks


Recovery time objective (RTO) = maximum allowable time to restore critical business functions after a disruption
Recovery point objective = maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured by a specific point in time before a disaster or outage
MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) = is used to describe the average time required to repair a failed component or device
high MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) value indicates that a component or system provides high reliability and is less likely to fail
MTTF (mean time to failure) = metric that represents the average amount of time a device or system is expected to operate before experiencing its first failure 




26. Agreement Types


SLA (service level agreement) = an agreement that specifies performance requirements for a vendor

MSA (Master Service Agreement) = formal and often legally binding document that outlines specific responsibilities, roles, and terms agreed upon by two or more parties

MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) = nonbinding agreement that outlines the mutual goals and general framework for cooperation between two or more parties

Work Order (WO) is a document that authorizes, initiates, and tracks the progress and completion of a particular job or task. 

Statement of Work (SOW) is a detailed agreement between a client and a vendor that describes the specific work to be performed on a project.

NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is a legal contract that restricts the person receiving confidential information from disclosing it to others. 

BPA (Business Partnership Agreement) is a formal contract between business partners outlining their rights, responsibilities, and obligations, 
including details about the management, operation, and decision-making processes within the business.




27. Penetration Testing

Penetration testing:
Bypasses security controls
Actively tests security controls
Exploits vulnerabilities


red team = attacker
blue team = defender
White team = overseer
purple team = combo of both red/blue

white-box = A penetration test performed by an authorized professional with the full prior knowledge on how the system that is to be tested works
grey-box = A penetration test in which the person conducting the test has limited access to information on the internal workings of the targeted system
black-box = A penetration test of a computer system performed without prior knowledge of how the system that is to be tested works 

Penetration testing = involves gathering any type of publicly available information that can be used later for exploiting vulnerabilities found in the targeted system
Active reconnaissance = passive reconnaissance relies on gathering information on the targeted system with the use of various non-invasive software tools and techniques, such as pinging, port scanning, or OS fingerprinting
